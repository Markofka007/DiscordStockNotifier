## Discord Stock Notifier
This is a python script(s) for a discord bot that can watch bestBuy products and notify the user(s) when that item is in stock. This is made for my discord server so I will likely add many more features but I will mainly focus on the stock notifier service.

### My Plan
- Command to add a link
- Bot pings user when link is in stock and removes link
- Command to see all links
- Command to see all links will also list item's title
- Notifier will ping all users who added same link
- >help page
- Add FileIO for persistence
